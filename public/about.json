  "background": "I live in Portland, Oregon, after spending my earlier years in Michigan and Illinois and going to college in Utah. My life's a mix of work, hobbies, and family. I'm into technology and coding, but I also make time for cooking and music.\n\nBeing a dad to a young toddler is a big part of my life. It's rewarding, fun, and keeps me on my toes. Balancing fatherhood with my personal interests and work is important to me.\n\nI've grown to love cooking, especially making dishes like cottage pie and baked salmon with roasted potatoes. It's a nice change of pace from the tech stuff.\n\nMusic has always been there for me, from playing piano and singing to joining choirs and being part of musicals in high school. It's something I still enjoy and find meaningful.\n\nI used to stream on Twitch and really liked the community aspect. I've stepped back for now but plan to get back into it because I miss the interaction.\n\nCoding isn't just a part of my jobâ€”it's a passion that extends into my free time, where I explore a variety of projects and challenges. Whether it's developing new software, tinkering with game development, or automating tasks, I'm always looking to push my skills and try new things.",
